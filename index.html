        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Hi! My name is <i>stdrice</i>. I'm a high school student, technically a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Y6lAwVK.png">tech (or newborn) paranoid</a>/digital minimalist, otaku(?).</li>
            <li>I love wandering around the Internet, listening to music, photo/lomography, tinkering tech stuffs, anime, manga, Japanese culture, etc.</li>
            <li>My mother tongue is Vietnamese, but I can also use English.</li>
            <li>I'm not addicted to video games anymore, but before, I played lots of different games. I have played video games since first time I used a computer (3yo). The first game I played was Counter Strike, it's still one of my favorite games.</li>
            <li>I listen to multiple genres of music, but mostly (lofi) hip-hop, (indie/pop/alt) rock and some subgenres of electronic music.</li>
            <li>I don't use social media because I'm concerned about privacy, and the knowledge I learned from social media is very small. Someone once told me I was an ape for not using social media.</li>
        </ul>
